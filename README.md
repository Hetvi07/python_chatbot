## What is chatbot?
A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse or pass the industry standard Turing test.

## Applications
- Messaging apps
- A part of company apps and websites 
- Chatbot sequences 
- Company internal platforms 
- Customer service
- Healthcare
- politics 
- Toys

## Limitations of chatbots

- As the database, used for output generation, is fixed and limited, chatbots can fail while dealing with an unsaved query.
- A chatbot's efficiency highly depends on language processing and is limited because of irregularities, such as accents and mistakes.
- Chatbots are unable to deal with multiple questions at the same time and so conversation opportunities are limited.
- Chatbots require a large amount of conversational data to train.
- Chatbots have difficulty managing non-linear conversations that must go back and forth on a topic with a user 
- As it happens usually with technology-led changes in existing services, some consumers, more often than not from the old generation, are uncomfortable with chatbots due to their   limited understanding, making it obvious that their requests are being dealt with by machines.

## About our project

In this Python project with source code, we are going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.  Let’s create a retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.
